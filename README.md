# Personal PoCs by Raul Andres
---

This repo is out of any technical scope apart to represent only a personal repo with some PoCs and useful commands notes or useful scripts to reuse by the author.

It shows some of the technologies/programming languages used by the author with chronology/history reasons.

It probably is *deprecated* about syntax, format and versions, so you must test it first to put in any production use.

It doesn´t follow the best gitflow best practices for SDLC and the author only commit to master branch due this is a personal git repo which receive commits only by the author. So, dear hiring managers reading this, please don't have this in mind ;)

It isn´t in any case a final version or completed version.

**Enjoy!**
