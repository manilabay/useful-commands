#when you run hiera commmand to debug your hierarchy you need specify where your hiera.yaml live, because hiera command search it on /etc/hiera.yaml 
#we need to create a symbolic link, linking where we have it, ok in /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml , normally
sudo ln -s /etc/puppet/hiera.yaml /etc/hiera.yaml


#Puppet runs as a daemon on the background every hour, but sometimes it is useful to trigger a run manually.
